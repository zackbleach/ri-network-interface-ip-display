# Display-O-Tron 3000 IP Display
==============================

A little Raspberry PI helper which shows the IP address of each network interface on an installed [Display-O-Tron 3000] (http://shop.pimoroni.com/products/displayotron-3000).

If you have this [run on start up](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/rc-local.md) you can plug an ethernet cable in, see the IP address, and ssh in to the Pi. Works with wifi (any network interface actually) too, so it saves you from having to configure a static IP!

Enjoy!
